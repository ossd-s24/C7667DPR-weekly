title: Week 7

This week our group began to narrow down the possible open source projects to contribute to. While we still need to make a final decision, we've managed to slowly go through a large communa list of potential projects, eliminating those which either: 
- require a certain background in a subject/language in which one or more of us are unfamiliar with
- has only one or two contributors
- has a large number of past contributors but is currently dead
- are known to deny pull requests for groups in the past (for whatever reason)

While there has been a ton of projects that were ultimately not good projects for us to contribute to, what we do have it narrowed down to (about 4) all seem to be good potential topics, and while the topics themselves might not be what we all had written down our interests to be (whether that be eduacational, music, etc.), I think each of these projects will posses attainable issue requests for us to work on, and will not exceed the scope of any of our knowledge basis.
