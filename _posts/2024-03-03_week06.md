# Week 6 Blog



Having looked at a bunch of projects by now, I've began to better gauge which types of projects are feasble to be able to contribute to as a beginner and which would be too difficult. Overall, I think it comes down to the specific work enviornment of each project, and is a lot less to do with the subject matter itself. For example, having looked at some social good projects, it was clear that some are looking for all the contributors they can get, whereas others where much more controlling of who contributes, even if the topics/goals of both projects seemed similar. Furthermore, having diven deeper into several other projects for the project evaluations such as Audacity and MuseSecore, being able to recognize the signs of a projects leniency towards new contributors by looking at things like the number and frequnecy of contributors and contributions has also been revealing as to how these projects are organized.



I'm very excited to be able to look through a projects issue tracking and at least start to examine the problems one by one to get a better understanding of the scale of some of these fixes are. While actually implementing the fixes will no doubt be the most challenging part, I think it will come down to the issues we pick as a group in determining whether we are succesful in getting pull requests approved.
